ANTLR4
=======

ANTLR4 provides an ANTLR4 to Raku Grammar converter.

The grammar, AST and Raku bindings are provided as separate modules, so you can view both the raw abstract syntax tree and the final Raku converted output.

Installation
============

* Using panda (a module management tool bundled with Rakudo Star):

```
    zef install ANTLR4-Grammar
```

## Testing

To run tests:

```
    prove -e perl6
```
